    <link>http://localhost:1313/index.html</link>
    <description>Introduction Kong Konnect is an API lifecycle management platform delivered as a service. The management plane is hosted in the cloud by Kong, while the runtime environments are deployed in your AWS accounts. Management plane enables customers to securely execute API management activities such as create API routes, define services etc. Runtime environments connect with the management plane using mutual transport layer authentication (mTLS), receive the updates and take customer facing API traffic.</description>

      <description>The Kong Konnect platform provides a cloud control plane (CP), which manages all service configurations. It propagates those configurations to all Runtime control planes, which use in-memory storage. These nodes can be installed anywhere, on-premise or in AWS.&#xA;For today workshop, we will be focusing on Kong Gateway. Kong Gateway data plane listen for traffic on the proxy port 443 by default. The data plane evaluates incoming client API requests and routes them to the appropriate backend APIs. While routing requests and providing responses, policies can be applied with plugins as necessary.</description>
